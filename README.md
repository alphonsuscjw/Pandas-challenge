## Summary of analysis

Across all 15 schools in the local government area, the average maths and reading scores are 70.34 and 69.98 respectively. 86.08% of all students in the area passed maths and 84.43% passed reading, but only 72.81% of students managed to pass both subjects.

All 15 schools are ranked by the percentage of students who passed both maths and reading. In the top 5 performing schools, the average maths score of students is roughly 72 and the average reading score around 71. Percentage of students who passed maths is about 91 whereas that of those who passed reading ranges from 86.67 to 89.07. 81.34% of students in the best performing school passed both maths and reading, with 79.42% of students in the 5th top performing school passing both subjects. On the other hand, in the 5 worst performing schools, students only have average maths and reading scores of around 69. While around 81% and 82% of students passed maths and reading respectively, only around 67% of students passed both.

By examining students' reading scores by each school year, we could realise that there is not much difference in marks across the school years for each school, with only 1-3 points of deviation between each year. The same observation applies to maths scores. The only exception is Holden High School, with a difference of 5 points in maths between years 9 and 10.

## Conclusions from the calculations

The first conclusion is that the amount of money a school spends on each of its students is not necessarily proportional to its students' academic performances. In fact, in the analysis of these 15 schools, schools with best performing students spent between $585 and $630 on each of their students whereas schools that spent more than $630 have students performing worse academically.

The second conclusion to be drawn is that the lesser number of students a school has, the better its students' academic performances. In this analysis, schools with less than 1000 students have higher average test scores and passing rates than schools with more than 1000 students.

The final conclusion is that students in independent schools seem to perform better than their counterparts in government schools. Our analysis shows that independent schools' students have higher average test scores and passing rates than students of government schools.
